## tl;dr How to deploy

1. Configure the deployment by creating a variable file in 'vars/' from a
   template as described in [vars/README](vars/README.md).
2. Install some dependencies:
   - `dnf install ansible python3-openshift python3-passlib jq make`
   - `dnf install origin-clients` or (for a more recent version) download
     `openshift-client-linux` from the [OKD
     releases](https://github.com/openshift/okd/releases) page, unpack it, and
     place `oc` in your `$PATH` (ex: `~/.local/bin`).
   - Download the [Bitwarden
     CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/#download-and-install),
     unpack and place it in your `$PATH` (ex: `~/.local/bin`).
3. `[SERVICE={service}] DEPLOYMENT={deployment} make deploy` (see
   [vars/README](vars/README.md)).

By default, the playbook checks that the local copy of the deployment is
up-to-date, and the variable file used is
up-to-date with the corresponding template.

To disable these checks, set `check_up_to_date` to `false` in the
variable file.

To only disable comparing the variable file to the template, set
`check_vars_template_diff` to `false`.

### Partial deployments

To run only the tasks related to some of the services, this way doing a
partial deployment, you can set the `TAGS` environment variable before calling
`make`. For example, to run only the tasks to deploy Redis and Redis
Commander, run:

    $ DEPLOYMENT=dev TAGS="redis,redis-commander" make deploy

Use `make tags` to list the currently available tags.
